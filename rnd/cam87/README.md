# CAM87

The CAM87 design evolved from the work on CAM86 and was introduced to the community by a series of posts by ``grim`` on

## Design comments

This appears to be a much improved design, the key features were mentioned by ``grim`` himself 

1. Powered by two common MC34063 converters instead of the expensive and hard-to-find MAX743. Broken MAX743 came from Aliexpress.
2. the processor was changed to the widespread STM32F103C8. Although the frequency is 72 MHz, only 36 MHz comes to the legs, but still faster than the AVR. It was possible to remove the reset pulse shaping circuit and the #WR pulse shaping circuit. Selection of parameters for RC-chains is no longer needed.
3. Dark stripes at the top of the frame, occasionally skipping at high shutter speeds, are suppressed. Horizontal unevenness is also suppressed.
4. The viewer rewrote the program in Visual Studio C #, now you can scale the picture with the mouse wheel.
5. The vertical scan is updated once a second, this allowed removing the overexposure of the first frame.
6. The target temperature and cooling on / off are now memorized in flash memory, so after an accidental power failure, the target temperature of the sensor is restored faster.
7. The board has the ability to make a sealed container for the sensor. If you pre-blow it with dry air, no fogging of the sensor is observed.

### Reduced hardware footprint

A dramatic simplification of the hardware design has been achievied:

* Use of the more powerful [SMT32F103C8 processor](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f103c8.pdf)
* removal of pulse shaping RC circuits (pulses are now generated by firmware)
* simplified power supply
* no preamp on CCD out
* ADC config via on board firmware

### Still some issues

1. No firmware source code published
1. Power regulators are still on the main camera board
1. Hardware flow control for USB Async FIFO operation not implemented
