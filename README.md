## Introduction

Something I've been wanting to do for years! -- Build a CCD camera for astrophotography. 
The [CAM86 project](http://astroccd.org/2016/10/cam86/), originating from a group of keen Ukrainian amateurs, looked like the perfect challenge. However that group has moved on to improved designs and there seems little point in proceeding with my own [CAM86 build](https://github.com/smr547/cam86). Perhaps we can build on their experience.

## This project

In this project I'd like to investigate building a camera of my own design utilising the invaluable experience shared by those associated with CAM86.
The key objectives are:

* minimum hardware footprint (do as much as possible in software)
* utilise a sensor that is readily available and fully documented by the manufacturer
* all design and software products to be fully open source 
* GitHub as the repository for all project products

## This repo

We are in the investigation stage so lets start with just a few directories:

* [rnd](./rnd) -- documenting all research and development associated with the project
* [Hardware](./hardware) -- the hardware design
* [Software](./software) -- the software (including on board firmware, host drivers and utility programs)
